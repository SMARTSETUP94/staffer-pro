# Architecture rules

- Keep the per-job logistics calendar in a dedicated dialog component using the existing logistics hooks and EtapeDialog; shared reads and edits stay consistent with the main planning.
- Derive occupied calendar dates with the pure calendrierChantier helper; this keeps multi-day coverage and empty-day filtering testable without UI snapshots.
